<pre>        To the Daisy
                     by W. Wordsworth

With little here to do or see
Of things that in the great world be,
Sweet Daisy! oft I talk to thee,
      For thou art worthy,
Thou unassuming commonplace
Of Nature, with that homely face,
And yet with something of a grace
      Which Love makes for thee!	 

Oft on the dappled turf at ease
I sit and play with similes,
Loose types of things through all degrees,
      Thoughts of thy raising;
And many a fond and idle name
I give to thee, for praise or blame,
As is the humour of the game,
      While I am gazing.	 

A nun demure, of lowly port;
Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court,
In thy simplicity the sport
      Of all temptations;
A queen in crown of rubies drest;
A starveling in a scanty vest;
Are all, as seems to suit thee best,
      Thy appellations.	 

A little Cyclops, with one eye
Staring to threaten and defy,
That thought comes next—and instantly
      The freak is over,
The shape will vanish, and behold!
A silver shield with boss of gold
That spreads itself, some fairy bold
      In fight to cover.	 

I see thee glittering from afar—
And then thou art a pretty star,
Not quite so fair as many are
      In heaven above thee!
Yet like a star, with glittering crest,
Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest;—
May peace come never to his nest
      Who shall reprove thee!

Sweet Flower! for by that name at last
When all my reveries are past
I call thee, and to that cleave fast,
      Sweet silent creature!
That breath'st with me in sun and air,
Do thou, as thou art wont, repair
My heart with gladness, and a share
      Of thy meek nature!
</pre>
