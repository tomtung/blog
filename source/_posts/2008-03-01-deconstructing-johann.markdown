偶然发现的一段很好玩的视频，是The King’s Singers在2000年巴赫音乐节表演的Deconstructing Johann。他们从巴赫的一些有名的作品中选出片段拼凑了一下，填上词，虚构出巴赫在写d小调托卡塔与赋格时与妻子很恶搞的对话。

注意看歌词哈：

> Deconstructing Johann<br />
>
> J. S. Bach had a little problem.<br />
> J. S. Bach was in a fix.<br />
> J. S. Bach couldn’t find an answer.<br />
> What to do?<br />
>
> “I’ve written most of a rather fabulous work!<br />
> Toccata, it’s in D minor, but now I’m feeling a bit of a jerk!<br />
> I can’t think of what should come after it…”<br />
>
> “Now,” said his wife, who was resting up after her 33rd child,<br />
> “Johann, my dear, you should just go to bed.<br />
> Something always comes up.”<br />
>
> “Don’t be a tweet!<br />
> It’s a real crisis and I’m working to a deadline!<br />
> What can I fit?<br />
> What to fit after the great toccata?<br />
> Maybe it needs to be something faster?<br />
> I haven’t got a clue<br />
> and in a week the piece is due.<br />
> I’m in a panic!<br />
> I’m stuck like glue!”<br />
>
> “Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Johann.<br />
> ‘Those are only notes’, you’ve always said.<br />
> There’s only twelve so use your head.<br />
> How many arrangements of twelve notes can there possibly be?”<br />
>
> “That’s a problem I don’t want to deal with.<br />
> How many permutations on C and D and E and F and G, A, B<br />
> is a thing that I never heard of.”<br />
> “You can leave that to Arnold Sch?nberg.<br />
> He is the person to do that twelve-tone thing.”<br />
>
> “No!! No!!!<br />
> It isn’t the answer!<br />
> I haven’t the foggiest!<br />
> What am I gonna do?<br />
> I’m all in a panic!<br />
> Aaah! No!”<br />
>
> “What can I do?<br />
> I’ve finished my toccata but I have no fugue.”<br />
> (Phone ringing)<br />
> “Aaah… and now I’ve got a fugue!”<br />

笑料很多，慢慢欣赏~
