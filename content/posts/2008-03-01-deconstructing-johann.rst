偶然发现的一段很好玩的视频，是 The King’s Singers 在 2000 年巴赫音乐节表演的 Deconstructing Johann。他们从巴赫的一些有名的作品中选出片段拼凑了一下，填上词，虚构出巴赫在写d小调托卡塔与赋格时与妻子很恶搞的对话。

注意看歌词哈：

    Deconstructing Johann

    | J. S. Bach had a little problem.
    | J. S. Bach was in a fix.
    | J. S. Bach couldn’t find an answer.
    | What to do?

    | “I’ve written most of a rather fabulous work!
    | Toccata, it’s in D minor, but now I’m feeling a bit of a jerk!
    | I can’t think of what should come after it…”

    | “Now,” said his wife, who was resting up after her 33rd child,
    | “Johann, my dear, you should just go to bed.
    | Something always comes up.”

    | “Don’t be a tweet!
    | It’s a real crisis and I’m working to a deadline!
    | What can I fit?
    | What to fit after the great toccata?
    | Maybe it needs to be something faster?
    | I haven’t got a clue
    | and in a week the piece is due.
    | I’m in a panic!
    | I’m stuck like glue!”

    | “Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Johann.
    | ‘Those are only notes’, you’ve always said.
    | There’s only twelve so use your head.
    | How many arrangements of twelve notes can there possibly be?”

    | “That’s a problem I don’t want to deal with.
    | How many permutations on C and D and E and F and G, A, B
    | is a thing that I never heard of.”
    | “You can leave that to Arnold Sch?nberg.
    | He is the person to do that twelve-tone thing.”

    | “No!! No!!!
    | It isn’t the answer!
    | I haven’t the foggiest!
    | What am I gonna do?
    | I’m all in a panic!
    | Aaah! No!”

    | “What can I do?
    | I’ve finished my toccata but I have no fugue.”
    | (Phone ringing)
    | “Aaah… and now I’ve got a fugue!”
